The Spider Of jikexueyuan.com

There are two difficult when I write this project:
1. The page's CSS selector change, so that the code i downloaded can not use anymore, and I need to update below string:
	title
	content
	classtime
	classlevel
	learnnum
	
2. Fail to save the content to txt file. after save the info, when open the txt file, the chinese turn to mass code. search long time in the Internet, no way to solve it. Suddenly, I think it should be the txt issue. 
Then i click the file, and then choose "save as", i change the code from "ANSC" to UTF-8, after that, every thing is OK.
